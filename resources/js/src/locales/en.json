        "List2_2": "Voice input via Telegram bot: Simply tell the bot what you ate; it uses OpenAI to recognize speech and suggests adding the product to your diary.",

        "Section4": "4. How does voice recognition work?",
        "Section4Text": "We use OpenAI's API (such as Whisper or GPT-based models) to convert your voice message into text. Then the bot analyzes that text, finds relevant products in the database, and suggests adding them to your diary. We do not store your audio files after processing.",

        "Section10Text": "We use HTTPS for secure data transmission between the client and server, and limit database access to trusted personnel/services.
